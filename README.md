# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a classic two person game. Players start each round by selecting rock, paper or scissors. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.
In this project the user plays against the computer over five rounds to see who wins. 

The game is a mixture of luck and logic.
